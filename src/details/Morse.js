				<p>Morse code is a character encoding that was invented by Samuel Morse, the inventor of the telegraph.  It represents each character of the english alphabet, some numbers and punctuations as a series of short and long signals.</p>
				<p>This encoding was mostly used in telegraphs a long time ago.  Signals were then transmitted by short or long electric pulses.  However Morse-encoded messages can be transmitted in a variety of other ways, such as radio waves, sound, or light.</p>
